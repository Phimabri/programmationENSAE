# ENSAE 1A: projet de programmation

The aim of the project is to build a road delivery network for transporting goods between cities. The minimum power required on each road for trucks to use them needs to be considered. The project consists of two parts: calculating the minimum power for each route and optimizing the purchase of trucks to maximize the profit from the covered routes.

Through this project we learn to optimize the computing time by using differents algorithm and approaches for a same problem. We also understand the specifities of each data structure and work a little on Graph Theory.
